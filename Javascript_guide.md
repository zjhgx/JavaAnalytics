# Closures

A **closure** is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the **lexical environment**). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.	

## Lexical scoping

Consider the following example code:

```js
function init() {
  var name = 'Mozilla'; // name is a local variable created by init
  function displayName() { // displayName() is the inner function, a closure
    alert(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
  }
  displayName();
}
init();
```

`init()` creates a local variable called `name` and a function called `displayName()`. The `displayName()` function is an inner function that is defined inside `init()` and is available only within the body of the `init()` function. Note that the `displayName()` function has no local variables of its own. However, since inner functions have access to the variables of outer functions, `displayName()` can access the variable `name` declared in the parent function, `init()`.	

Run the code using [this JSFiddle link](http://jsfiddle.net/xAFs9/3/) and notice that the `alert()` statement within the `displayName()` function successfully displays the value of the `name` variable, which is declared in its parent function. This is an example of *lexical* *scoping*, which describes how a parser resolves variable names when functions are nested. The word *lexical* refers to the fact that lexical scoping uses the location where a variable is declared within the source code to determine where that variable is available. Nested functions have access to variables declared in their outer scope.
